The program takes input data from patients, processes it using a predictive model (presumably trained on past data), and then provides an output in terms of these metrics. This aligns with the methodology employed in machine learning applications.

# Diabetes Prediction Program

This machine learning application predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-input health metrics. It uses a decision tree model trained on real-world data from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, providing accurate and interpretable predictions.

## Features
- **User Input Prediction**: Users can enter health metrics, and the model will immediately predict the likelihood of diabetes based on these inputs.
- **Accuracy and Metrics Reporting**: The program outputs metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score to assess model performance.
- **Data Visualization**: The decision tree is visualized to help users understand the model’s decision process. Additionally, a confusion matrix displays the model’s predictive accuracy across classes.

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Indicates the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. A higher value signifies that the model is highly accurate in its predictions.
- **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions (i.e., cases where the model predicts diabetes). A high precision means that when the model predicts diabetes, it is often correct.
- **Recall**: Captures how many actual positive cases (people with diabetes) were identified by the model. High recall means the model successfully identified most positive cases.
- **F1 Score**: Provides a balanced measure of the model’s precision and recall. An F1 Score closer to 1 indicates strong overall model performance.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data loading, preprocessing, and manipulation.
- **train_test_split**: To split the data into training and testing sets.
- **DecisionTreeClassifier**: For building the decision tree model.
- **plot_tree**: For visualizing the decision tree structure.
- **confusion_matrix & ConfusionMatrixDisplay**: For creating and displaying a confusion matrix to analyze model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes `accuracy_score`, `precision_score`, `recall_score`, and `f1_score` to evaluate the decision tree model’s performance.

## Usage
1. **Data Input**: Users enter relevant health metrics, and the program processes these inputs to predict diabetes likelihood.
2. **Prediction Output**: The result is printed to
